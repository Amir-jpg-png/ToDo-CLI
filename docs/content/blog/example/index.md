## Origin of the To Do CLI

I was bored and i was thinking or programming.

For a while now rather than using IDEs and other GUI code editors, I have been using nvim.

Other than that I also began to work on bigger projects (might correspond with my nvim usage), and always faced a problem of solving a bug and forgetting what to do next.

That is how I came up with the To Do CLI i made it using a python script and made it executable globally.

## Future Plans

I might come back to this project in the future in that case, I will try to implement the following features.

- Color coded tasks
- version flag
- man page
- better naming
- increased SEO for the website
- uncheck option

That's it for the next version if there is one.

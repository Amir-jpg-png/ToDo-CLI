# How to contibute
We are always happy about PRs even if they are only corrections of a typo!

To begin simply follow the steps below:
+ Fork this repo
+ checkout to a new branch with a sensible and descriptive name (feature/, bug/)
+ fix a bug / implement a new feature / ...
+ commit your changes
+ push your changes if are done
+ open a new Pull Request to merge your changes into the main branch
+ be open to feedback

## How to set up the environment
+ Clone your fork
+ create and activate a virtual environment inside the directory (`python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`)
+ install all required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
